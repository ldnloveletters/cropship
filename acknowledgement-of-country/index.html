            <h1>Acknowledgement of Country</h1>
            <p>Cropship acknowledges the Traditional Owners of Country throughout Australia and recognises their continuing connection to land, waters and community. We pay our respects to Elders past and present and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with whom we work.</p>
            <p>We are committed to meaningful reconciliation and to building sustainable futures in partnership with First Nations communities.</p>
